        <h2>Test Today</h2>

        <p>Nearly 1 out of every 15 homes in the U.S. is estimated to have elevated radon levels. Elevated levels of
            radon
            gas have been found in homes in Fresno, Clovis, surrounding San Joaquin Valley homes, and in homes in the
            Sierra Mountains. While radon problems may be more common in some areas, any home
            may
            have a problem. The only way to know about your home is to test.</p>

        <h2>The EPA And the Surgeon General recommend testing for radon</h2>

        <p>Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk from radon.
            Testing is inexpensive and easy.
            The EPA and the Surgeon General recommend that you test your home for radon.
            Millions of Americans have already tested their homes for radon.
            Keep yourself and your family safe. Test today.</p>

        <h2>The testing process</h2>

        <p>Testing your home for radon is easy. Simply call us and book an appointment.
            The appointment will take place at your house. One of our technicians will come to your home
            and install testing equipment. The equipment is small and quiet. The equipment will be placed in an
            unobtrusive location. Setting up the equipment only takes a few minutes.
            After two days, our technician will come back to your house, pick up
            the equipment, interpret your results, answer questions, and provide solutions.</p>

        <h2>Testing fees</h2>

        <p>Testing your home for radon is inexpensive. The fee for testing is $100. A refundable deposit of $150 is
            required for each testing unit.
            We usually leave 2 - 3 units so that we may obtain readings from different areas in your home.</p>

        <h2>Radon measurement</h2>

        <p>Radon is measured in picocuries per liter (pCi/L).
            If your radon level is 4 pCi/L or higher, the EPA and the Surgeon General recommend
            that you fix your home. Radon levels less than 4 pCi/L still poses a risk which, in many cases, may
            be reduced. The EPA believes that any radon exposure carries risk -
            no level of radon is safe. Even radon levels below 4 pCi/L pose some risk, and you can reduce your
            risk of lung cancer by lowering your radon level.</p>

        <p>The average indoor radon level is estimated to be about 1.3 pCi/L.
            About 0.4 pCi/L of radon is normally found in the outside air.
            The U.S. Congress has set a long-term goal that indoor radon levels be no more than outdoor levels.
            While this goal is not yet achievable in all cases,
            most homes today can be reduced to 2 pCi/L or below.</p>

        <h2>Radon and selling your home</h2>

        <p>More home buyers and renters are asking about radon levels before they buy or rent a home.
            Because real estate sales happen quickly, there is often little time to deal with radon and other issues.
            The best thing to do is to test for radon now and save the results so that you may share them with the
            buyer.
            If your home has elevated radon levels, fix the problem now so that it won't complicate your home sale.</p>

        <h2>How to lower radon levels in your home</h2>

        <p>There is no known safe level of radon. You can reduce your risk by decreasing radon levels in your home.</p>

        <p>There are several proven methods to reduce radon in your home. The method primarily used is a vent pipe
            and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside. This system, known as
            a soil suction radon reduction system, does not require major changes to your home. Sealing foundation
            cracks and other openings makes this kind of system more effective and cost-efficient. Similar systems can
            be installed in houses with crawl spaces. Our licensed contractors might use other methods.
            The right system depends on the design of your home.</p>

        <p>Lowering high radon levels requires technical knowledge and special skills. Our contractors are licensed and
            trained to fix radon problems. We will study the radon problem in your home and find the best solution for
            lowering radon levels in your home.</p>

        <p>After we have installed a system for lowering radon levels in your home, we will test your home again
            to ensure that radon levels have been reduced to a safe level. Our soil suction radon reduction systems
            also include a monitor that will indicate whether the system is operating properly.</p>


        <h2>Radon and home renovations</h2>

        <p>If you are planning a remodel, it is important to test the area for radon before you begin. If you have
            elevated radon levels, radon-resistant techniques can be inexpensively included as part of
            the remodel. Because major renovations can change the level of radon in any home, always test again after
            work is completed. Contact us so that we may help you make your home a safe and healthy place to live.</p>

        <h2>Our company, our family</h2>

        <p>We are a local, family-run business. We began this business because we became aware of the cancer-causing
            hazard
            that radon poses. After our son was born, I learned that children are particularly
            susceptible to the negative health impacts of radon. At the time
            there was no local business that provided radon testing or mitigation. In order to keep our family safe,
            we educated ourselves. We learned how to test for radon and how to reduce radon levels. The
            first radon mitigation system we installed was in our home. I am happy that our home is now free from the
            unnecessary danger of hazardously high radon levels.</p>

        <p>Helping people stay safe, helping people protect their families, and helping people
            avoid cancer is what our business is all about. As we talked to friends and family about radon, we realized
            there are many people who can benefit from what we have learned. We partnered with our cousin who is a
            licensed general contractor and our business was born.</p>

        <p>Our goal is to help people stay healthy so that they can
            live and enjoy their lives.</p>
